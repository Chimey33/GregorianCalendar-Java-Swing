# GregorianCalendar-Java-Swing
A small GUI that finds and prints a date in the Gregorian calendar
Takes three inputs, the day, the month and year and for any year after 1582 will return the day and the week the date 
can be found on.

Once found, the program will print the calendar for the year you have input and will highlight the date you have selected. It
will also state the day that the date is on (Monday, Tuesday, etc)
